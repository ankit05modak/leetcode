## Objective
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

### n is the input length
## Time Complexity
Because of a nested for loop, the time complexity becomes **O(n^2)**

## Space complexity
In the worst possible case, all elements of the nums satisfy the condition, space complexity becomes **O(n)**
