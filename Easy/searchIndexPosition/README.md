## Objective
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Time Complexity
1. Binary search method is used to solve this problem. This has **O(log(n))** complexity.

## Space Complexity
1. The variables are only memory consuming, hence **O(1)**

## Note: 
* Do your share of reasearch on Binary Search algorithm, try to understand the theory behind it. The solution is a piece of cake later.
